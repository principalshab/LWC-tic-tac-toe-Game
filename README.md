<h1>Tic-tac-toe Game with Lightning Web Component in Salesforce</h1>
This is a simple implementation of the popular game Tic-tac-toe using Lightning Web Components (LWC) in Salesforce. The game is played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns to place their mark (either X or O) on the grid. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

This implementation uses LWC to create a reusable game component that can be easily integrated into any Salesforce application. The component is built using modern web development techniques, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to be responsive and accessible.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To use the Tic-tac-toe game component in your Salesforce application, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Create a new Lightning Web Component in your Salesforce org.
Copy the files from the cloned repository into your new Lightning Web Component.
Add the new Lightning Web Component to a Lightning page or record page in your Salesforce org.
Play the game!
Usage
Once you have installed the Tic-tac-toe game component in your Salesforce org, you can easily add it to any Lightning page or record page. Simply drag and drop the component onto your page, or use the Lightning App Builder to add the component to a page.

To play the game, simply click on any empty cell in the grid to place your mark. The game will automatically switch between players and determine the winner once three marks are in a row. You can reset the game at any time by clicking the "Reset" button.
